Based on the industry standard ESP8266 (ESP-12S Series), the SDK includes:

BME-280, to provide a low power
Barometric Pressure, 300-1100 hPa
Temperature, -40 to +85°C
Humidity, 0-100% Relative (± 3%)
SFH2440, to provide a high linearity Ambient Light Sensor.
Spectral range of 400 to 690 nm
Connections

The CWX has four headers.

BMx Sensor header
Micro USB (Flashing and Debug)
I2C (expansion and OLED)
DC In
